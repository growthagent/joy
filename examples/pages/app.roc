# An app split into pages where each page is its own URL: /counter, /clock
# and /notes are plain links, following one loads a new page, and the model
# holds only the page on screen. Leaving a page throws its state away. That
# is the shape of a server-rendered app the client hydrates, where the
# server picks the page from the path and each page starts fresh (see
# examples/fullstack/), so the path is what this app boots from too: the
# page passes location.pathname as the flags (see www/index.html).
#
# The page modules are the same as in examples/spa_pages/, which keeps every
# page's model alive and switches between them in place. Only this file
# differs, so the two are easy to compare.
